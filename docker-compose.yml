      # Option A — Unraid / bind mount (recommended for Unraid):
      #   Set DATA_PATH in a .env file or export it before running compose.
      #   e.g. DATA_PATH=/mnt/user/appdata/cardboard
      #   This keeps your database on the protected array and survives Docker resets.
      # Option B — Docker named volume (default, works on any Docker host):
      #   Remove the ${DATA_PATH:-...} line and uncomment the named volume line below,
      #   or leave as-is; Docker manages the storage location automatically.
